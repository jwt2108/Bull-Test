        <p>The Thorbardin Ranch conducted a series of Highland Bull tests from 2000-2004. There were 5 tests conducted.</p>
        <p>All bulls in the tests were born in the same year of the test, arriving at the ranch in late November or early December.
        The test period was 112 days (4 X 28 Day Weight Check events).</p>
        <p>The 2004/2005 test was not included in this dataset. It appears that the enthusiasm may have started to wain at this point.
            Most of the bulls were Thorbardin Ranch bulls, of which most if not all do not appear in the AHCA herdbook.
            There were a handful of other probable AHCA bulls but not enough animals to warrant the effort to
            include the data.</p>
        <p>All of the Thorbardin Ranch summaries as well  as the datasheets can be found at this url:

        <h3>Bull Ages</h3>
        <p>Over these four tests, the bull ages range between ~200 - ~317 days old. This would suggest that most if not all the bulls had been weaned prior to arriving at the test.

        <h3>Initialization</h3>
        <p>Upon arrival the bulls seem to have been sorted into pens with peers in size and age to attempt to balance feed competition among the bulls.
            There was a warm up period to allow for the bulls to settle from travel and adjust to the new environments. </p>
        <p class="italic">It should be noted, bulls appear to have traveled from as far as Vermont (Owl Rock Farms, Jim & Lorri Welsh are 
            represented in the spreadsheets) as well as Washington, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan so the settling time was important to ensure a fair evaluation. </p>

        <h3>Milestones</h3>
        <h4>- Initial Weigh In</h4>
        <p>After a warm up period, the initial weigh in of all the bulls was recorded.</p>
        <p class="italic">This is a significant data point. All the bulls Date of Birth (DOB) was recorded and in most cases a birth weight was recorded. </p>
        <p>
            Using the DOB and the initial weigh in data, one can determine how many 'Days Old' the bull was at initial weigh in. Also, using this information one can 
            estimate Average Daily Gain (ADG) and also estimate the bulls 205 Day Weight. </p>
        <p>
            This information can be useful in evaluating the bull's performance
            prior to the test period.
        </p>
        <p>
            These estimated calculations can also be useful in evaluating the performance of the dam's calf raising abilities as well as
            assessing the potential of the genetics to produce quality carcasses. 
        </p>
        <h4>- 28 Day Milestone Weigh Checks</h4>
        <p>Four follow on milestone weigh ins were recorded every 28 days for the duration of the test. 
            These events enabled assessment of performance with regard to ADG during the test periods. 
        </p>
        <p>It is interesting that the ADG continues to increase through the test milestones. First Milestone Weigh In averages 1.56 lb per day, followed
        by 1.97, then 2.52 and finally 2.76.</p>
        <p style="color:blue"; style="font-style: italic;" >See Image 2 on Right 'ADG Milestone Averages'</p>

        <h4>- Final Metrics</h4>
        <p>
            At the end of the test period (~112 days) the final weights were recorded. At this time, a veterinarian conducted a Breeding Soundness Exam (BSE) 
            that included penis extension, semen quality and testicle examination.
        
        </p>
        <p>
            The BSE was conducted using an elecro ejaculator and and the semen analyzed immediately. Bulls that failed the initial drawing were resampled up to 5 times. 
        </p>
        <p class="italic">Some bulls did not pass the BSE and were not offered in the auctions.</p>
